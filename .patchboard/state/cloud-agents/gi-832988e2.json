  "prompt": "Please assume the role of systems-analyst (read .patchboard/agents/systems-analyst/index.md)\n\n---\ntitle: Plan Task from Documents\n---\n\nPlease read the following document:\n\nPB-Galaga Architecture\ndesign-architecture/core/architecture.md\n\nReview the current system, conduct a gap analysis and plan the implementation tasks.\n\nArchitecture:\n1. The game will run entirely in the browser/client.2. The game will use a 'Fixed time step with synchronization' engine.3. Game loop (engine) and game state should be decoupled from the renderer, so the game can be run and tested in a \"headless\" mode.4. The game state should be double buffered (current and previous) allowing for interpolation (rendering) to reduce lag. It is envisioned that Phaser (latest) will be used for rendering.5. All game object types should have their own test harness, that allows them to be run in an isolated instance of the game engine, state and render. These harnesses will have test menus that allow all game object modes and animations to be tested in isolation (both rendered and headless)6. The game should support one player or two player co-op modes\nThe codebase should be structured like so:\n/engine (game loop, manager, menu systems)/objects (players ships, enemies, projectiles, power ups, bosses, asteroids etc)/objects/[object type]/sounds/*/objects/[object type]/animations/*/objects/[object type]/code/levels (metadata/code for arranging enemies, enemy flight paths and other level content such as background, foreground objects or effects)\nExample objects are:\nPlayer ships- thrusters\u00a0- fire modes- power up modesEnemies\u00a0- thrusters\u00a0- fire modesProjectiles\u00a0- rockets- misses- lasers- bullets- plasmaPower ups- health- shield- firepower\u00a0- stealth\u00a0\nEngineering strategy:\nIt is envisioned that we will take a 'test first' approach, meaning test scripts and AI must be able to advance the game loop and run tests to validate game state. The render pipeline should be as 'dumb' as possible.\nVisual Design:\nThe game is intended to have a modern pixel-art arcade feel.\nSprint 1\nImplement core game engine, state, renderer\nImplement one player ship (red)Implement one player movements/controlsImplement player ship harnessImplement player collision sequence\u00a0\nImplement player laser (projectile)Implement player laser harness\u00a0Implement laser collision sequence\u00a0\nImplement enemy type A (non firing alien transport)Implement harness for enemy type AImplement enemy destruction sequence\u00a0\nImplement start game menu sequence, menu should include player control information.\nImplement a simple first level, including a single swarm of enemy type A\nImplement player lives (start with 3)Implement player one score (accumulation when enemies are destroyed)\nImplement level content (background stars) moving with player flying motion\u00a0\nImplement game over sequence (on player death)\nSprint 2\nAdd two player (blue ship) support including controls\nImplement enemy type B (slow fighter with laser projectile)\nImplement bullet projectile\nImplement enemy type C (mobile fighter with bullet projectile)\nExpand level 1 to include multiple enemy waves (type A, followed by type B, followed by type A+B, followed by type C, followed by type A+C)\nImplement level 1 complete sequence (occurs once all waves a defeated)",
