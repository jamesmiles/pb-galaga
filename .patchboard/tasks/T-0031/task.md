## Context

The original 140 BPM gameplay track was too harsh and aggressive. Replaced with an airy, atmospheric space synth that complements the game's visual aesthetic without overwhelming the player.

## What was delivered

Replaced the gameplay music track with an atmospheric space synth at 105 BPM using 3 instruments (warm sine pad, deep sub-bass, soft arpeggiated shimmer) in a pentatonic scale (C-D-E-G-A) with sparse patterns and breathing room.
