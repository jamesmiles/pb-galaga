# Project Vision

<!--
Define your project's vision here. This document is referenced by agent
workspaces (engineer, systems-analyst) to understand the "why" behind tasks.

Consider answering these questions:
-->

## What problem are we solving?

<!-- Who experiences this problem? How do they cope today? -->

## What does success look like?

<!-- Describe the desired end state. What changes for users? -->

## Principles

<!-- What values guide technical and product decisions? For example:
- Simplicity over configurability
- Convention over configuration
- Offline-first
-->

## Non-Goals

<!-- What are we explicitly NOT doing? This prevents scope creep. -->
