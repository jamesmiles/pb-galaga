# Design & Architecture

This directory contains architecture documentation, design decisions, and ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) for the project.

## Structure

```
design-architecture/
  index.md              This file
  core/
    architecture.md     System architecture overview
    data-model.md       Data schemas and invariants
    system-context.md   Actors, boundaries, external systems
  adrs/                 Architecture Decision Records
```

## Getting Started

1. Start with `core/architecture.md` to document your system's key components
2. Use `core/data-model.md` to define your data schemas and validation rules
3. Use `core/system-context.md` to map actors and external dependencies
4. Create ADRs in `adrs/` for significant technical decisions
